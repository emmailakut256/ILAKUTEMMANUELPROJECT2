The primary goal of this project is to analyze sentiment trends in Ugandan tweets for the year 2024. 
To achieve this, we introduce abstractions that enhance modularity, readability, and reusability, making the system scalable for larger datasets and future extensions. 
By grouping, tokenizing, analyzing, and visualizing sentiments monthly, the abstractions streamline data processing while providing insightful visual outputs.
